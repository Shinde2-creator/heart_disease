Model Comparison for heart disease prediction
I recently completed a project on heart_disease prediction based on train and testing,evaluating models and comparising the same.
Train and test is done on 80-20%
Models are SVM,Gradient Boosting and Random Forest.Gradient Boosting performs best for AUC-ROC indicates strong classification ability .Random Forest has the hightest F1-score ,balancing recision and recall well.
